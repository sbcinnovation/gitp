GITP: Pretty git branch exploration for the terminal.

- Use Golang.
- Terminal based.
- VIM keybind as primary key mapping.
- Must provide branch.
- List all chronological commits in that branch.
- Allow for collapsing/uncollapsing commits
- Muted/Unmuted background styling (subtle different between the two) for files changed in a commit.
